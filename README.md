- Hi, I'm Colbren Fujimoto
- I'm currently interested in Software Development and Robotics
- I'm currently learning ROS and localization
- I'm a Freshman in Computer Engineering
- I chose this major because I was interested in both computer hardware and software
- A fun fact about me is: I enjoy traveling and want to visit Korea
